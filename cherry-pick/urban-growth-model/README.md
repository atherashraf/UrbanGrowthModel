# urban-growth-model
A Cellular Automata urban growth model

The final project for MATH-UA 9251 Introduction to Mathematical Modeling. Taken at NYU's Berlin campus with professor Ralph Banisch.

The project is a stochastic cellular automata model of Urban Growth that builds off of R White and G Engelen's model from this [paper] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.456.5056&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
Read the [report](Report.pdf) for the final report and look at the [IPython notebook](Project.ipynb) for the code behind the report.
